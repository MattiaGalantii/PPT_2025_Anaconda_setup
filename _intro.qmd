## Two Ways to Write and Run Python Code

There are two main ways you can program in Python for this course:

1. **Anaconda (Recommended)**: simple, all-in-one installation.  
2. **Google Colab**: online and quick, but limited control.

## Option 1: Anaconda (Recommended)

:::

**Anaconda** is the easiest and most reliable way to get started with Python for data and scientific applications.

It includes:

- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **Spyder** (ready to use)
- A built-in **package and environment manager** (Conda GUI)
- Pre-installed scientific libraries (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

## Option 2: Google Colab (Alternative)

:::

If you cannot install software locally or you run into issues, you can use **Google Colab**:

- It runs completely in the browser  
- Requires only a Google account  
- No Python installation needed  
- Lets you upload notebooks or open them directly from GitHub  
- Already includes most common Python packages (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

⚠️ However:

- Internet connection is required  
- File and environment control is limited  
- Some advanced features may not be available
